# MCÂ²= E Lab â€“ Materials under Challenging Conditions for Energy Applications

This repository hosts the website for the **MCÂ²= E Lab**, a research group in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at Texas A&M University.


## About the Lab
We develop multiscale and multi-physics models, reduced-order models, and AI/ML tools, to understand and engineer nuclear and energy materials.  
Our work spans:
- Multiphysics & multiscale modeling of materials in extreme environments 
- AI/ML-driven reduced-order models for materials properties and performance   
- Advanced nuclear fuels, claddings, and structural materials for advanced reactors
- Materials for Fusion Energy
- Battery Materials
